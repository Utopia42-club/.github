**Welcome to Utopia42.club**

Utopia42 is a decentralized Multiverse. Different organizations, communities and projects can deploy their own Metaverse and start to build their own 3D world. Utopia42 was launched on Polygon as the first blockchain. The protocol is multichain and soon will use the Muon Network to support other blockchains.

Utopia42 is not just a platform for entertainment. We invite organizations and businesses to offer their services to everyone on a borderless and decentralized platform. Utopia42 can provide real world people, groups and places a virtual platform for Universities, Virtual Offices, Museums, Libraries and more.

Users on Utopia42 can have an unique ID and prove their uniqueness using BrightID. Users can browse all of the 'Verses using their own ID and avatar and all of the activities of the users can be attached to their IDs as soulbound tokens.
